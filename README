Designed to rip images from a custom CMS based loosely on vBulletin.

The URLs look like <site>/xx_xxxxx_xx.html

Usage:

perl PicRip.pl -u <user> [-p <password>] -url "<forum URL>"

If you do not specify a password you will be prompted; this may be desireable if you don't want the password on the command line history.

The script will initiate authentication to the forum and begin downloading images from the specified URL. It will save it's state to
disk so that you can recover from interruption or keep your local caache up-to-date with the forum. It will also start the download from
the url specified, so if you've already downloaded the first 20 pages just plug in the url for page 20 and start there, instead of having
to scan and skip the first 20 pages.

This script does require the JSON module to be installed. On Mac or Linux a simple "sudo cpan install JSON" should take care of this dependancy.
